While not much of the "front-end" of the website has changed, extensive work has been done to completely revamp the background architecture that the Living Hope website sits on. This means that we'll be able to unveil new and exciting features in the near future potentially even including paypal integration to allow for online giving (something that has been requested a number of times).

Look forward to more changes soon!
