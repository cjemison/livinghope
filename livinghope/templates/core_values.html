And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people.

Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.">Galatians 5:13-26</a>

                    We believe that we were made for relationships that spur us on to continue growing in the gospel. We want to see our community grow to be Christ-centered, grace-driven, and authentic in how we love and serve one another. We want to see genuine relationships form where people are encouraging and challenging one another to live a life on mission. We need community to help us confront sin and to teach us how to love others better.

Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching; the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.">Romans 12</a>

                    Whenever we gather together as a church community, we visibly demonstrate our identity as the body of Christ. We are one body but many parts and each of us is called to participate in building up His church with the unique gifts and talents that God has given us. We believe that Christ is the head of the church and that the church belongs to its members. Therefore we hope that each member takes part in growing and nurturing the life of the church. We desire to raise up new leaders regularly who will continue to direct our weekly ministry activities and shepherd others to live out our mission as a church.

                    The gospel is the greatest news so we long for those around us to come to know God. We are called to live our lives for the sake of the gospel and to become the hands and feet of Jesus so that the name of Christ would be exalted in the nations. We don’t want to become a cultural club that’s focused on programs but a church that’s living out its mission through relationships and service. We seek to look for ways to put our faith into action and serve where there are needs in hopes of sharing the love of Christ.

            As followers of Christ, we hope to live our lives in response to what Jesus Christ has done for us. We believe that God is sovereign over all things and that we are called to offer everything we have to be used for God’s glory. We seek to honor God with our whole lives and that includes our time, possessions, money, talents, and relationships.

            We believe that every person was created in the image of God so we want to welcome all people into our church despite race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. We believe that God created each person with a unique cultural background so we want to embrace who we are and the unique cultures represented while not preferring one group over the other.

And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people.

Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law. And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the Spirit. Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.">Galatians 5:13-26</a>

            We believe that we were made for relationships that spur us on to continue growing in the gospel. We want to see our community grow to be Christ-centered, grace-driven, and authentic in how we love and serve one another. We want to see genuine relationships form where people are encouraging and challenging one another to live a life on mission. We need community to help us confront sin and to teach us how to love others better.

            <a href="#" class="btn-sm btn-default" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" title="Romans 12 (ESV)" data-content="I appeal to you therefore, brothers,by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned. For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another. Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith; if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching; the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness. Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.” To the contrary, “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.">Romans 12</a>

            Whenever we gather together as a church community, we visibly demonstrate our identity as the body of Christ. We are one body but many parts and each of us is called to participate in building up His church with the unique gifts and talents that God has given us. We believe that Christ is the head of the church and that the church belongs to its members. Therefore we hope that each member takes part in growing and nurturing the life of the church. We desire to raise up new leaders regularly who will continue to direct our weekly ministry activities and shepherd others to live out our mission as a church.

            The gospel is the greatest news so we long for those around us to come to know God. We are called to live our lives for the sake of the gospel and to become the hands and feet of Jesus so that the name of Christ would be exalted in the nations. We don’t want to become a cultural club that’s focused on programs but a church that’s living out its mission through relationships and service. We seek to look for ways to put our faith into action and serve where there are needs in hopes of sharing the love of Christ.

                        <p>
                            It's all too easy to simply come to church and mentally, emotionally, and spiritually check out. We believe attending a church service is more like a family gathering than watching a movie so our "Call to Worship" is always meant to draw us back into community with each other and with God and to encourage us to consider why we worship.

                        <p>
                            This is a slight misnomer. At Living Hope we believe that praise and worship are more than just songs we sing together but rather how we live our lives. We believe that we can worship and praise God through our occupations, our relationships, in addition to our voices and songs. At the same time, we believe it's important to come together corporately to sing to God and each other what He has done for us and who He is. Perhaps the best way to describe our typical musical style would be "Hillsong mixed with time-tested hymns".

                            We believe we are called to preach the Gospel to the ends of the earth.

                        <p>
                            Just as we worship through singing and music, we also worship through the hearing of God's word preached to us. We believe that God's word is living and active meaning that God is actively speaking to us through it into our individual circumstances and hearts.

                            After hearing a message, this is an opportunity to let the truths of who God is and what He's done for us "soak in". This is also a good opportunity to respond to all of that in prayer.
